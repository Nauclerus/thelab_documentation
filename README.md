This is the repository containing our scripting, research and notes concerning our The Lab research project on Malicious Hardware.

## What is Malicious Hardware
Malicious Hardware in essence, is hardware that is dedicated to a "malicious" function concerning the privacy of the victim. These are not always pieces of software strictly.

In this repository, you will find practically all of our documentation that we wrote concerning our The Lab project. A small overview of the contents:

- [A hardware analysis of devices like a Rubber Ducky](./hardware-analysis.md), what are they, how and who manufactures them?
- [A overview of tools and methods](./mitigation_overview.md) one can employ to protect themselves against HID-attacks.
- A written overview of our demos we prepared for our the Lab presentation. That being the [webcam demo](./camera_demo.md) and the "ransomware" demo
