# Malicious Hardware Research Project Scope

## **Project Overview**

### **Ethical Research and Awareness of Malicious Hardware Tools**  

### **Background**  
Malicious hardware devices, such as USB-based attack tools (e.g., Rubber Ducky, Evil CROW USB cable), pose significant cybersecurity threats. These tools can be used for penetration testing and ethical hacking but can also be misused for unauthorized attacks. This project will research their functionality, risks, and ethical use while making an attempt at raising awareness among both technical and non-technical audiences.

## **Objectives**

- **Ethical Charter Development:**  
  - Create and enforce a comprehensive ethical charter.  
  - Secure sign-off from all project members.

- **Establishment of Research questions**
  - Create the primary research questions that you want to answer within this project.
  - Establish hypotheses.

- **Capability & Risk Assessment:**  
  - Analyze the functionalities and risks of malicious hardware tools. Primary focus is on the aforementioned Rubber Ducky and Evil CROW USB cables.  
  - Research other attack tools and their documented exploits.

- **Payload Demonstrations:**  
  - Develop safe, controlled payload demonstrations.  
  - Provide documentation and explanations for each payload.

- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  - Identify countermeasures against malicious hardware threats.  
  - Propose best practices for risk mitigation.

- **Awareness & Education:**  
  - Develop educational materials tailored for both technical and non-technical audiences.  
  - Conduct live demonstrations and training sessions.

## **Scope of Work**

### **In-Scope**
- **Ethical Framework:**  
  - Draft and finalize the ethical charter.  

- **Research & Analysis:**  
  - Perform a technical study of malicious hardware.  

- **Payload Development:**  
  - Create proof-of-concept payloads in a controlled lab setting.  
  - Document the development and testing process.

- **Mitigation & Defense:**  
  - Assess existing defenses against hardware attacks.  

- **Educational Outreach:**  
  - Produce slide decks, guides, and training materials.  
  - Organize awareness sessions for diverse audiences.

### **Out-of-Scope**
- Unauthorized development or distribution of payloads.  
- Deployment of malicious hardware outside a controlled environment.  
- Legal or regulatory advice beyond the internal ethical framework.

## **Deliverables**

- **Ethical Charter:**  
  - A formalized charter signed by all project members.

- **Technical Analysis Report:**  
  - Detailed breakdown of malicious hardware capabilities and risks.

- **Payload Artifacts:**  
  - Code files, documentation, and demonstration logs.

- **Mitigation Strategy Documentation:**  
  - Research-based recommendations for security measures.

- **Awareness Materials:**  
  - Presentations and educational resources for technical and non-technical audiences.

- **Live Demonstration:**  
  - A controlled demonstration of a malicious hardware payload. For non-technical audiences, we ensure explanations are as clear as possible, using minimal technical jargon.
