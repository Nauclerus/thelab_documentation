# Mitigation of HID attacks

Welcome to this small subfolder where we elaborate on the details of the methods outlined in the [Mitigation overview](../mitigation_overview.md) document. A small overview of the contents:

- [Details](./mitigation_account_session.md) on the limiting of account capabilities to limit intrusion possibilities
- [Details](./mitigation_driver_level_control.md) on the potential for driver-level control blocking, unfortunately not viable.
- [Details](./mitigation_white_black_listing.md) on the whitelisting and blacklisting one can do with the device IDs.
- [Details](./mitigation_endpoint_security_software.md) or rather links to some open-source software that's capable of detecting and stopping HID attacks.
