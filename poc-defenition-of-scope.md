# Proof of Concept (PoC) Scope Definition

**Development and Demonstration of Payloads for Rubber Ducky & Evil Crow Cable with Mitigation Strategies**

## Objective
The goal of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to develop, test, and demonstrate payloads for **Rubber Ducky** and **Evil Crow Cable**, showcasing their potential impact as attack vectors. Additionally, the PoC will explore and propose mitigation strategies to counter these types of threats in enterprise and personal security environments.

## Scope

### 1. Payload Development
- Design and implement various payloads for **Rubber Ducky** (USB HID attack) and **Evil Crow Cable** (malicious USB cable).
- Develop scripts and automated execution sequences that could potentially demonstrate:
  - Credential harvesting
  - Remote command execution
  - Data exfiltration
- Possibly ensure payloads are effective across multiple operating systems (**Windows, Linux, macOS**).

### 2. Testing and Demonstration
- Deploy the developed payloads in a controlled lab environment.
- Capture and analyze the behavior of the attack vectors.
- Document the impact of each attack, including:
  - Execution time
  - Stealth level
  - Potential damage

### 3. Mitigation Strategies
- Research and propose countermeasures to defend against **Rubber Ducky** and **Evil Crow Cable** attacks.
- Develop security configurations, policies, and monitoring techniques to detect and prevent:
  - Unauthorized HID (Human Interface Devices) devices
  - Malicious USB connections
- Evaluate the effectiveness of endpoint security solutions and enterprise-grade defenses against these threats.


## Out of Scope
- Any unauthorized or unethical use of the developed payloads outside of a controlled, approved environment.
- Targeting real-world systems without explicit permission.
