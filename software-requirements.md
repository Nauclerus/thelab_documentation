# Software requirements

## Objective
The purpose of the software requirements is to give the user an idea of what software was used to create the payload and how to mitigate it. At the start of the project, these are more likely to be capabilities of mitigation tools and payload development tools

### 1. Payload Development
 - Ducky Script Encoder: To write and encode scripts for Rubber Ducky (Hak5 Encoder)
 - Bad USB Payload Repository: Explore GitHub repositories with example payloads

### 2. Payload testing
 - Virtual machine: for a safe testing environment
 - Metasploit framework: can be useful for penetration testing and payload delivery

### 3. Mitigation
 - Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions (Windows Defender ATP, Sysmon, etc.)
 - USB Security Policies – Configure security measures in any operating system if possible

*If we end up using a GitLab repository with example payloads, we will include the specific repository in here.*
